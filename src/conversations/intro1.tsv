This is the second module in the series.
I will guide you through three (3) different modules today.
It is important that you complete all three modules.
I am showing a slider at the bottom of the screen.
The slider is to the right of the words 'Delay (in seconds)'.  
"To change how fast messages are sent, move the slider with a mouse (or with a finger if you have a touch screen)"
"The slider is initially set to '5', meaning I send a message every 5 seconds."
Lower numbers on the slider cause messages to be sent faster. 
"For example, if you move the slider to '2', I will send a message every 2 seconds."
