Welcome back!
"When you do type, you will almost always press just a single key"
(Your screen saver may switch on since you will be typing very little.)
The keys you press usually will be on the left side of a QWERTY keyboard.
"If you have been using a mouse, I suggest that you consider stopping using it now."
Some have found using a mouse to be awkward and/or distracting.
"Do you want to continue to Blended or skip ahead to Sustained?"
