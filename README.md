## Conversations

The /conversations directory holds .tsv files with the guided directions the bot delivers for each module. These files should be created and edited in a software that handles tsv files such as excel or numbers so that the proram will automatically escape commas, apostrophes, etc when exporting to tsv. Manually editing tsv files could lead to parsing errors. 

## Lib
The /lib directory contains the chatbot library. Customizations have been made to the ChatBot.jsx file to meet the specific needs of this chatbot-like program.

## Components
/components directory contains custom component code.
